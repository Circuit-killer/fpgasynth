FPGA Synth

This is an experiment in hardware audio synthesis using direct floating point 
computation of sinusoids. All floating point operations are implemented in
verilog.

Currently implemented is a hardware unit for computing sinusoids.

The eventual target is an Altera DE1 development board. Once I obtain the
FPGA board, I will start adding the necessary hardware components to produce
the sound.
